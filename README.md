Your task is to program the Contact Form and Location section from this design comp: https://xd.adobe.com/view/ededf3a0-40f0-4305-b340-a0e4fc891519-b8be/grid.

We have provided a starter site that has the header and footer already complete. 

### Dev Requirements

- Your form does not need to be able to send an actual email
- Extra points are given for form validation

Note: For the different tab views, you can just use the same contact form multiple times.
